Chapter 3: Into the Forest
The forest loomed ahead, thick with mystery and shadows. Unfamiliar sounds echoed beneath the canopy, and vines twisted like serpents. Armed with nothing but a map and their wits, they pressed on, deeper into the darkness, where the promise of adventure mingled with the scent of fear and anticipation.
As they ventured further into the forest, the sunlight began to fade, swallowed by the dense foliage above. Every step seemed to awaken a symphony of rustling leaves and distant calls—an orchestra of the unknown. The map, worn and crumpled, indicated a hidden glade just beyond the next ridge, a place rumored to hold secrets lost to time.

“Stay close,” whispered Lena, her voice barely above a murmur. Marcus nodded, gripping his makeshift weapon—a sturdy branch he had found along the path. The sensation of unseen eyes watching them danced on the back of his neck.
